These analyses compute one EM update of the edge rate coefficients,
following the setup of Figure 16.4 of
Inferring Phylogenies (2004) by Joseph Felsenstein.

Due to the properties of the Jukes-Cantor substitution process
used in this example, the updated edge rate coefficients are equal to the
conditionally expected number of substitutions on each edge.
